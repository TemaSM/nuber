# Port Fowarding

So that your instances can be reached from the outside world you will need to setup port forwarding for the ports that your services need.

From the instances home, click on the **instance** that you want to configure port forwarding, enter the **external port** to listen on and then the **internal port** where the traffic will be forwarded to in instance.

Click on the **forward traffic** button to setup the traffic forwarding.

To remove the traffic forwarding, click on the **X** icon next to port configuration that you want to remove.
